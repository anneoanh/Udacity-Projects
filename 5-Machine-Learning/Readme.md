# Machine Learning with Enron scandal

Enron Corporation is an energy company based in Houston Texas. In 2000, it was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

This project will attempt to identify the person of interest (POI) in the Enron scandal through a series of steps:

#### 1. Understanding the Dataset and Question  
- Data Exploration  
- Outlier Investigation
    
#### 2. Optimize Feature Selection/Engineering  
- Create new features  
- Intelligently select features
    
#### 3. Pick and Tune an Algorithm  
- Examine Naive Bayes  
- Examine Decision Tree  
- Examine K Nearest Neighbors  
- Examine and tune Support Vector Machine  
- Examine Random Forest  
- Pick an algorithm    
- Tuning Decision Tree  
- Tuning Linear SVM  
- Tuning Random Forest  
- Classifier Comparison Results
            
#### 4. Validate and Evaluate
- Final Decision Tree Results  
- Viewing the tree  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report
