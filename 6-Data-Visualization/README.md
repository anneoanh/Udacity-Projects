Summary

This data set contain information about 1157 baseball players and their handedness (right, left, or both handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs. This visualization summarizes the total number of players with the home run averages, height, and weight among players' handedness over the life time of their career.

Design

In this visualization, I choose to use the bar graph to represent the data set because it show comparisons between the avg home runs among different handed players. I find this very interesting because the majority of the baseball players are right handed and that brought the home run averages down for right  handers. In my initial design, I created the total home runs for the three different handed players and started requesting feedback.

While awaiting feedback, I began digging a little deeper I found that it is known that left handed players have an advantage over right handed players. Being left handed, they stand closer to first base which give them 1/6 of a sec faster to first base with batting momentum. They also have better visuals of the ball while at bat than right handers because they don't have to look over their left shoulder to see the ball coming from behind them.

When I received the feedbacks, I realized that my visualization requires more information to clarify some confusions that my viewers had about the data. I decided to make a few changes and combine it with my new discovery to show that left handed players have an advantage over the other handed players. 

1. What is the unit for homeruns? 
2. Is it the average of homeruns all the studied right handed players have over their life time of baseball career?
3. Where are the the height, weight, and  batting averages depicted?
4. Are these totals by left-handers, right-handers, and both?

For the first revision, I added three additional visuals to show the total players, avg height, and avg weight. These visuals interactive through radial buttons on top of the visualization. However, this turned into an exploratory visualization.

For the final visualization, I follow the martini glass principle to show three separate bar graghs. By removing the radial buttons, the viewers are guided throught the first graph showing weight, second height, and the final is the average home runs. Each visualization includes additional information leading to the final visualization as the viewer scroll down the page.


Feedback

Feedback #1
What do you notice in the visualization?
The graph is clear and easy to understand.

What questions do you have about the data?
What is the unit for homeruns? Is it rhe average of homeruns all the studied right handed players have over their life time of baseball career?

What relationships do you notice?
I notice the relationship of handedness and homeruns.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Right handed players got more homeruns.




Feedback #2
What do you notice in the visualization?
I first see a data graph in blue. The x-axis shows the number of home runs and the y-axis shows the handedness.

What questions do you have about the data?
Where are the the height, weight, and  batting averages depicted?

What relationships do you notice?
The graph shows the relationship between handedness and home runs.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Comparison between handedness and number of home runs. Prediction of one's home run average using variables of handedness.



Feedback #3
What do you notice in the visualization?
I noticed the color change and the additional information that was displayed on mouseover.

What questions do you have about the data?
Are these totals by left-handers, right-handers, and both?  If so, it may be more interesting to show multiple graphs: 
1) Graph by type: left-handers, right-handers, both
2) Average home-run by batter type

What relationships do you notice?
There are more right-handed home runs.  This makes sense since there are probably more right-handed batters.  Also, there are very little home runs by both-handed batters.  

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
The main take-away is that most batters are right-handed.
